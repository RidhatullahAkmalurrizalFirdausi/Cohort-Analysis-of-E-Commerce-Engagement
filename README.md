# Key Insight
The heatmap visualizes retention rates across various customer cohorts, revealing how customer engagement changes monthly. 
Several cohorts show significant drop-offs in customer retention after just the first or second month, 
suggesting potential issues with the customer experience that could be addressed to improve early retention. 
These findings emphasized the need for effective engagement strategies to maintain customer interest and prevent churn.
